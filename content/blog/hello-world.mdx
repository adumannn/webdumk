Welcome to the very first post on this site. My goal is to be radically transparent about how I design, build, and iterate on digital products.

## Why a fresh portfolio?

> Great products are not accidents—they are the result of intentional systems.

After collaborating with teams of all sizes, I wanted a home for the lessons I keep repeating:

- Accessibility is a product requirement, not a feature request.
- Tooling should serve focus, not friction.
- Fast feedback loops create better outcomes.

## Principles I follow

| Pillar                 | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outcomes over output   | Define success in terms of user value, not ticket counts.       |
| Quality at every layer | Invest in testing, accessibility, and performance from day one. |
| Systems thinking       | Treat design systems and architecture as evolving products.     |

### Crafting inclusive experiences

Inclusive design starts before the first line of code. It means aligning with research, writing accessible copy, and ensuring we test with a diverse set of users.

```tsx
export const buildExperience = () => {
  return {
    accessibility: 'baked-in',
    performance: 'optimized',
    collaboration: 'async-first',
  };
};
```

## What to expect

Expect case studies that highlight measurable outcomes, deep dives into front-end architecture, and reflections on cross-functional collaboration.

Thanks for being here—more soon.
